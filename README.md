# README #

Repo for updated drivers and documentation for CMD recon - a branch of the CMD Robots project of 2012.

https://github.com/wallarug/cmd-robot

The aim of this repository is to create a Python driver for CMD Recon to interface with the [donkey car](https://github.com/wroscoe/donkey) code.  This will provide a second platform for testing.  

This is an extension to the existing scope of the project.
